    <h2>treatment</h2>
    <p>
    At this time, there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect
    against COVID-19.
    
    Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own. Your health care provider may recommend steps you
    can take to relieve symptoms.
    
    Consult your health care provider as soon as possible if:
    
    you are concerned about your symptoms or
    you have a travel history to a region where severe coronaviruses are known to occur
    The sooner you consult your health care provider, the better your chances are for recovery.
    
    Flu vaccine will not protect you
    While coronaviruses are a respiratory illness, these infections are not the same as those that cause the flu. If you
    have received a flu vaccine, it will not protect against coronaviruses.
