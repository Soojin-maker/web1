<h2>symptoms</h2>

    <p>
        Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19
        because they are similar to a cold or flu.<br>
        
        Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known infectious period for
        this disease.<br> We are currently investigating if the virus can be transmitted to others if someone is not showing
        symptoms. While experts believe that it is possible, it is considered to be rare.
        <br>
        <br>

        Symptoms have included:<br>

        
        <ul>fever</ul>
        <ul>cough</ul>
        <ul>difficulty breathing</ul>
        <ul>pneumonia in both lungs</ul>
        In severe cases, infection can lead to death.
